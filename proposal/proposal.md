"None the less, Barth is the most important Protestant theologian since Schleiermacher, and the extraordinary descriptive depth of his depiction of the Christian faith puts him in the company of a handful of thinkers in the classical Christian tradition." Webster, Barth, 1.

"the significance of Barth's work in his chosen sphere is comparable to that of, say, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Freud, Weber or Saussure in theirs, in that he decisively reorganized an entire discipline." Webster, Barth, 1.

"The doctrine of election ... is one of the most crucial chapters in the *Church Dogmatics* as a whole, summing up much of what Barth as had to say so far and pointing forward to essential features of the doctrines of creation and reconciliation." Webster, Barth, 88.

"Von Balthasar's judgment that Barth's treatment of election is 'the most magnificent, unified and well-grounded section'  of the *Church Dogmatics*, 'the heartbeat of his whole theology', was reached before Barth had begun to publish on the doctrine of reconciliation; but he is not wide of the mark." Webster, Barth, 93. See Balthasar, *The Theology of Karl Barth*, 174.

"There can be no Christian truth which does not from the very first contain within itself as its basis the fact that from and to all eternity God is the electing God. There can be no tenet of Christian doctrine which, if it is to be a Christian tenet, does not reflect both in form and content this divine electing... There is no height or depth in which God can be God in any other way." Barth, CD II/2, 77.


Webster has a line about the way that Barth introduces a topic then comes around at it repetitively from a number of different angles. Look also at Paul's book (intro) to see if he has something similar about Barth's circling. This would explain why we would expect to not see a great deal of differentiation across paragraphs, but also would expect that once a topic is introduced, it becomes regular thereafter.

What is Barth actually trying to say with his doctrine of election? That is, what would a set of words be that reflects that work that doesn't explicitly use 'elect+' or 'predestination' or 'decision/decree' or 'eternal' or 'reject+'?
